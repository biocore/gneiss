    "In this study, there were 18 patients with cystic fibrosis.  The hypothesis was that there were two main microbial communities at play in the CF lung.  One of these communities thrives at low pH, and the other community thrives at high pH.  To test this, sputum samples were divided among 8 tubes, and each of the tubes was perturbed with a different pH.  Here we will calculate balances, and test how these balances change with respect to pH, using linear mixed effects models."

    "Similar to the 88soils example, there is a very obvious transition from low pH organisms to high pH organism as the pH increases.  However, given that every patient has different microbes, so it is difficult to test for individual microbes abundances across patients.  However, every patient has microbes that behave the same with respect to pH.  Balances is a very powerful tool for addressing this, as it can allow for entire subcommunities to be tested, rather than just individual OTUs."
