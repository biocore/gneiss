    Parameters
    ----------
    formula : str
        Formula representing the statistical equation to be evaluated.
        These strings are similar to how equations are handled in R and
        statsmodels. Note that the dependent variable in this string should
        not be specified, since this method will be run on each of the

    table : pd.DataFrame
        Contingency table where samples correspond to rows and

    metadata: pd.DataFrame
        Metadata table that contains information about the samples contained
        in the `table` object.  Samples correspond to rows and covariates
        correspond to columns.
    tree : skbio.TreeNode
        Tree object where the leaves correspond to the columns contained in
        the table.
    **kwargs : dict
        Other arguments accepted into `statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS`

    Returns
    -------
    RegressionResults
        Container object that holds information about the overall fit.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from gneiss import ols
    >>> from skbio import TreeNode
    >>> import pandas as pd

    Here, we will define a table of proportions with 3 features
    `a`, `b`, and `c` across 5 samples.

    >>> proportions = pd.DataFrame(
    ...     [[0.720463, 0.175157, 0.104380],
    ...      [0.777794, 0.189095, 0.033111],
    ...      [0.796416, 0.193622, 0.009962],
    ...      [0.802058, 0.194994, 0.002948],
    ...      [0.803731, 0.195401, 0.000868]],
    ...     columns=['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ...     index=['s1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5'])

    Now we will define the environment variables that we want to
    regress against the proportions.

    >>> env_vars = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'temp': [20, 20, 20, 20, 21],
    ...     'ph': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]},
    ...     index=['s1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5'])

    Finally, we need to define a bifurcating tree used to convert the
    proportions to balances.  If the internal nodes aren't labels,
    a default labeling will be applied (i.e. `y1`, `y2`, ...)

    >>> tree = TreeNode.read(['(c, (b,a)Y2)Y1;'])

    Once these 3 variables are defined, a regression can be performed.
    These proportions will be converted to balances according to the
    tree specified.  And the regression formula is specified to run
    `temp` and `ph` against the proportions in a single model.

    >>> res = ols('temp + ph', proportions, env_vars, tree)

    From the summary results of the `ols` function, we can view the
    pvalues according to how well each individual balance fitted in the
    regression model.

    >>> res.pvalues
           Intercept            ph      temp
    Y1  2.479592e-01  1.990984e-11  0.243161
    Y2  6.089193e-10  5.052733e-01  0.279805

    We can also view the balance coefficients estimated in the regression
    model. These coefficients can also be viewed as proportions by passing
    `project=True` as an argument in `res.coefficients()`.

    >>> res.coefficients()
        Intercept            ph      temp
    Y1  -0.000499  9.999911e-01  0.000026
    Y2   1.000035  2.865312e-07 -0.000002

    The balance residuals from the model can be viewed as follows.  Again,
    these residuals can be viewed as proportions by passing `project=True`
    into `res.residuals()`

    >>> res.residuals()
                  Y1            Y2
    s1 -4.121647e-06 -2.998793e-07
    s2  6.226749e-07 -1.602904e-09
    s3  1.111959e-05  9.028437e-07
    s4 -7.620619e-06 -6.013615e-07
    s5 -1.332268e-14 -2.375877e-14

    The predicted balances can be obtained as follows.  Note that the predicted
    proportions can also be obtained by passing `project=True` into
    `res.predict()`

    >>> res.predict()
              Y1        Y2
    s1  1.000009  0.999999
    s2  2.000000  0.999999
    s3  2.999991  0.999999
    s4  3.999982  1.000000
    s5  4.999999  0.999998

    The overall model fit can be obtained as follows

    >>> res.r2
    0.99999999997996369

    ...         'u3': ilr_inv(np.array([1.1, 8.1]))},
    ...         index=['a', 'b', 'c']).T

    Now we are going to define some of the external variables to
    test for in the model.  Here we will be testing a hypothetical
    longitudinal study across 3 time points, with 4 patients
    `x`, `y`, `z` and `u`, where `x` and `y` were given treatment `1`
    and `z` and `u` were given treatment `2`.

    >>> metadata = pd.DataFrame({

    ...               'z1', 'z2', 'z3', 'u1', 'u2', 'u3'])

    Finally, we need to define a bifurcating tree used to convert the
    proportions to balances.  If the internal nodes aren't labels,
    a default labeling will be applied (i.e. `y1`, `y2`, ...)

    >>> tree = TreeNode.read(['(c, (b,a)Y2)Y1;'])

              \Y2------|
                        \-a

    Now we can run the linear mixed effects model on the proportions.
    Underneath the hood, the proportions will be transformed into balances,
    so that the linear mixed effects models can be run directly on balances.
    Since each patient was sampled repeatedly, we'll specify them separately
    in the groups.  In the linear mixed effects model `time` and `treatment`
    will be simultaneously tested for with respect to the balances.
