Canonically pronouced *nice*


gneiss is a compositional data analysis and visualization toolbox designed for analyzing high dimensional proportions.  See [here](https://biocore.github.io/gneiss/) for API documentation.
 
Note that gneiss is not compatible with python 2, and is compatible with Python 3.4 or later.
gneiss is currently in alpha.  We are actively developing it, and __backward-incompatible interface changes may arise__.

# Installation

To install this package, it is recommended to use conda.  First make sure that the appropriate channels are configured.

```
conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda
conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/biocore
conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/qiime2
conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/qiime2/label/r2017.6
```

Then gneiss can be installed in a conda environment as follows
```
conda create -n gneiss_env gneiss
```
To install the most up to date version of gneiss, run the following command

```
